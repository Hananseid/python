    <h1>MY PERSONAL BIO </h1>
    <p> My name is hanan seid and I am a third year software engineering student in Addis Ababa University.<br>I really
        wanted to join software engineering cuase I have been passinate and interested about technology especially about
        cyber security. </p>
    <h2> Education: </h2>
    <p> As I mention before I am a software student in Addis Ababa University. I am in a third year and I have been
        taking so many programming language courses especially html, css and javascript. Most of the time I like doing
        some website works. </p>

    <h2> Skills: </h2>
    <p> I really want to say i am just starting to know some programming languages and I am saying I am not perfect or I
        do not think I have good knowledge about those programming languages <br>so I am working to improve my skills
        and those languages that I have been taking are like python, c++, java, html, css, and javascript. <br> Now
        currently I am learning html and css online and I am trying my best to develop good skills. and I plan to learn
        python and c++ again cause I found out those are basic and fundamental skills that I must be perfect at those.
    </p>

    <h2> Interset and Hobbies:</h2>
    <p> I am very intersted about technology what I mean is when i see the services, networks, machines.... most things
        that made by human being. <br>I really question my self how they came up with the idea and how they did perfect
        and great work that do most and unbelievable things <br> then I wanted to find about thoses technologies that is
        why I choose software engineering cause I think that is the best field which is close to those technologies.<br>
        To be honest I like to spend my free time with family. and my hobby is doing some research on something which I
        found it interesting.
